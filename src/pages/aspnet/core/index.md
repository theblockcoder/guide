ASP.NET Core uses the MVC (Model-View-Architecure) Model.

Asp sends requests to certain controllers based on the routing setup which then get data from a model and return a view with that data.

Controller: Handels Request,
Model: Is the data,
View: Is the actual view into which the data is plugged into
